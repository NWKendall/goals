  "I commit to myself on this day, to be the best version of myself. Not just because Giulianna deserves it, but because most importantly you deserve it yourself. To be my best self, I must have the courage to face my fears, to welcome failure and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow by trying again. To not use failure as an excuse to sabotage or delay the achievements of your goals. To be patient with others, especially in the presence of ignorance.To be humble enough and patient with myself, when I recognize or others point out my own. To offer my opinions only when invited, or in defense of others or my own principles, or when in pursuit of a deeper truth. Appreciate others in their process.To continue to search for meaning greater than hedonism, even when I perceive none. To accept the world is mad, and that I can only be responsible myself and lead by example. And to ultimately accept that any meaning of significance I do find has no permanence, is transitory, but to relish it regardless. To be present, to be curious and to enjoy the small things. To live";
